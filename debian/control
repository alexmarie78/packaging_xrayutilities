Description: X-rays data reduction and analysis (Python 2)
 xrayutilities is a collection of scripts used to analyze x-ray
 diffraction data. It consists of a Python package and several
 routines coded in C. It especially useful for the reciprocal space
 conversion of diffraction data taken with linear and area detectors.
