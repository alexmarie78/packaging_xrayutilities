Description: Package for xray data reduction and analysis
 xrayutilities is a collection of scripts used to analyze x-ray diffraction
 data. It consists of a python package and several routines coded in C. It
 especially useful for the reciprocal space conversion of diffraction data taken
 with linear and area detectors.
